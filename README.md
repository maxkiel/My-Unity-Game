# Club-Auto-Sport
A simple Unity Game

I have a vision of a simple street car racing game fused with a little bit of role playing flavour.
Player would have to compete on streets to earn enough reputation to join a local racing club.
Club would then help the player advance in game through sponsoring and getting the player into local racing events.
Once enough reputation is earned, club would get famous and the player would now be able to compete in world class street racing events at different locations.
Artificial Agents in this game would all have characteristics of (kinda) real life players with their own skillsets and levels.
Police in this game would also be active since street racing is illegal in this world.
